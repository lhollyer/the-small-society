<h1>About The small Society</h1>
<br>
<div>
 <p>The small Society is being established to promote the mental health and wellness of individuals and to support the 
    recovery of persons experiencing mental illness, particularly where individuals are unwilling or unable to access
    support from the NHS or existing social services. 
 </p>
<br>
 <p>Its primary aim is to support Carers of the 'cared for' with particular reference to those caring from mental
     disorders, in particular but not exclusively by providing a place of refuge for a short term stay and also by 
     providing funds for respite purposes.
 </p>
<br>
 <p>The small Society also aims to provide or produce information and resources that will further the understanding
     of issues around mental health with a particular reference to the needs of carers and those supporting individuals
     with a mental health condition.
